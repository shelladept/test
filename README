Test program for learning how github works.
Use it if you'd like, but I can't imagine why you would O_o

But seriously folks:
Ensure you have installed the G++ compiler then run 'make' from the target directory.
#mkdir mySweetNewDir
#cd mySweetNewDir
#git clone git://github.com/shelladept/test.git
#make

fin!
